# Quadtrees
Some Quadtree implementations inspired by a [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) Coding Challenge

I watched Dan Shiffman (@shiffman) on the Coding Train (@codingtrain) implement a QuadTree in JavaScript and thought I would have a try in C++. The
algorithm seemed straightforward and I thought it would be a fun exercise since I rarely get to do C++. Then when I was
trying to learn some Rust, I also ported it to Rust.

I am not affiliated with the Coding Train, I just like the videos

###### Disclaimer: I have fairly strong knowedge of Python and C++ but Swift and especially Rust are not languages that I have a lot of experience writing, and so the implementations may not be that efficient

### Ranking So Far

| Language | Relative Speed |
| -------- | -------------- |
| C++      | 1.0            |
| Rust     | 1.5            |
| Swift    | 2.0            |
| Ruby     | 5.0            |
| Python3  | 10.0           |

Speed is done in relative multiples. So, for example, this means that python3 was 10 times slower than C++ and 2 times slower than Ruby
or that Swift was 2.8 times faster than Ruby.

Actual run time in time units are not provided due to their variability and platform specificity.
