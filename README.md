# Quadtrees
Some Quadtree implementations inspired by a [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) Coding Challenge

I watched Dan Shiffman (@shiffman) on the Coding Train (@codingtrain) implement a QuadTree in JavaScript and thought I would have a try in C++. The 
algorithm seemed straightforward and I thought it would be a fun exercise since I rarely get to do C++. Then when I was 
trying to learn some Rust, I also ported it to Rust. 

I am not affiliated with the Coding Train, I just like the videos
