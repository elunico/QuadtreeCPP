# QuadTree

This is an implemenation of a QuadTree just for fun that I copied from [this Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/098.1-quadtree) Coding Challenge. I followed the implementation in this video, but did it in C++ because I don't do a lot of C++ and this seemed like it would be fun. This is not a serious library, and is just something I was trying for fun.
